excerpt: "This is my Project Log. This is my honest attempt at documenting my work, and my sharing creative methods. This site is in at early stage and it's progress will ebb and flow with my time. I am a lifelong hobbyist, veteran, and Electronics Engineer in New Orleans. I like to make and fix everything, especially airplanes, robots, 3D printing, PV, art, and electronics. I make oceanography instruments for a living."
